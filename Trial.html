            <p class="project-description">The goal of this database project was to develop a comprehensive and efficient database management system to store, organize and manage data for Sonner Tire Company. Sonner Tire Company identified its need for data process that keep up with the rate of growth in the organization. The project involved the design, development, testing, and implementation of a database system for Sonner Tire Company. This database allows Sonner Tire Company to accommodate increasing sales and service volumes as the organization grows. Working alongside three team members, our initial task was to engage with the client, seeking their expectations for the desired database system. Subsequently, we crafted an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that comprehensively addressed the articulated needs of the client. Following this, our responsibilities extended to executing both the logical and physical design aspects and conducting database testing through the formulation and execution of SQL statements.</p>

            <h3 class="project-title">MIS Field Project</h3>
            <p class="project-description">Our project was based on data provided by the company QVC. The company provided 6 datasets: customers, email campaigns, orders, products, product airtime, and social media use. Each of these datasets was pulled from the first quarter of 2023, January 1 to March 31. We leveraged this data to create a database in SQL Server Management Studio. Using our chosen business intelligence tool, Tableau, we conducted an in-depth analysis. Our project focused on evaluating the effectiveness and methods of advertising, sales, and general consumer behavior. We assessed the impact of advertisements and campaigns from both a financial/company spending perspective and a quantity of orders placed context. Additionally, we examined sales patterns and consumer behavior based on location, while also considering external factors.</p>

            <p class="project-description">The question we wanted to explore was how global sales were impacted by different factors of video games. The video game industry is dynamic and ever-evolving, with numerous factors influencing global sales trends. Our research delved into understanding the intricate interplay between platform types, game genres, and regional sales patterns to uncover insights that could inform strategic decision-making in the gaming industry. To achieve this, we utilized various methods like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and association rules.</p>

Using One-Shot Learning, we attempted to create a robust Siamese Neural Network that is good with identifying similarity in facial images.
